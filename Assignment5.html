          1). Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It
          allows developers to embed a video or audio file on their website.
          HTML5 video can use CSS to style the video tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          2). HTML5 allows to use a figure element to mark up a photo in a
          document, and a figcaption element to define a caption for the photo.
          The figcaption tag defines a caption for a figure element. This tag
          provides a container for content that is equivalent to a figure. It
          can be used to group a caption with one or more images, a block of
          code, or other content.
        </p>
        <p>
          3). The 'progress' tag is used to check the progress of a task during
          the execution. Progress tag can be used with the conjunction of
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            4). The nav tag defines a set of navigation links. It is used for the part of an internet site that links to different pages at the website. The hyperlinks can be organized through a number of approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            5). With the use of 'header' and 'footer', there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a div tag. Footer is placed at the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. By using header and footer HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what to load later.
        </p>
        <p>
            6). Placholder Attribute - The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field/text area. The short hint is displayed in the field before the user enters a value.
        </p>
        <p>
            7). Email Attribute - When the input type in the form set as email, then the browser gets the instruction from the code to write a valid format email. The input email id is automatically validated to check the format of the email id is correct or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            8). Storage - In the case of HTML, we can use the browser as the temporary storage whereas, in the case of HTML5, application cache, web SQL database, and web storage is used.
