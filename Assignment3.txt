Question 3 - Define accessibility in the context of web development. Discuss why it's essential to create accessible websites and how it benefits user groups?

# Accessibility - Accessibility is the practice of making our websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

# Reason to create accessible websites :-
1). We can think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them equal opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances.

2). Accessibility is the right thing to do. Providing accessible sites is part of the law in some countries, which can open up some significant markets that otherwise would not be able to use your services or buy your products.


# Benefits of creating accessible web pages :-

1). Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.

2). Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.

3). Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
